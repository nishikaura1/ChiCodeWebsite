# ABOUT CHICODE

ChiCode acknowledges that amidst the CoVID-19 outbreak, many students' summer porgrams and activites have been cancelled or postponed. ChiCode would like to provide students an interactive online experience when learning Python and Java. Our mentors are motivated to help students learn in any way they feel comfortable by keeping the student mentor teacher ratio low for more perosnalized guidance.
